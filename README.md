# Psychic-Game

The purpose of this game is to guess what letter the computer randomly generates.

You have a total of 9 guesses to get the letter right.

The JavaScript limits the guesses to letters only as well.

After 9 guesses have been made, you will either have guessed the correct letter and incremented your "Wins" up by one or not have guessed the right letter and had your "Losses" section incremented by one.
